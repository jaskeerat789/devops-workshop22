# Chapter-2
In this Chapter we take a more deeper dive on what you should take care while building docker images. Docker image size have been a huge pain when it comes to managing the images in your repository. We also want to save expensive built time for these images.

# Cutting down the image size
- Using image size
    - using better base image 
    - using multi-stage builds

# Cutting down build time 
- Using smaller base images to save time on downloading them.
- Using cached layers to your advantage.
